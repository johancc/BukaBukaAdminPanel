// Step 1: 

// Create a function that makes a POST request to buka's wake up API endpoint


// Step 2:
//      Make it so when the "wake-up button" is clicked, then function from step 1 is called


// Step 3: Repeat steps 1-2 to make the sleep button work


// Step 4 (optional): Make a POST request which sets buka's happiness
//  (hint: you'll need to get the value of the input field)
